3. Read the instructions provided on the page.
4. Choose one of the following options:
   - To create an experiment under the Virtual Labs consortium:
     - Follow the instructions to raise an issue in the engineers-forum provided on the page.
   - To create an experiment under your own organization:
     - Follow the instructions to create a secret token and provide the necessary permissions.
5. Once you have created the experiment repository, proceed to the next section for modifying the repository.

### Modifying an Experiment

1. On the Virtual Labs CMS landing page, click on the "Modify" tab in the navigation bar.
2. In the form, enter the experiment repository name.
3. Click the "Modify" button.

## Using the Virtual Labs CMS

This section describes the key features and functionalities of the Virtual Labs CMS. For additional guidance, click on the "i" icon located in the bottom right corner of the page to access the help document.

### Modifying Experiment Components

The Virtual Labs CMS provides two editors to create experiment components: Markdown editor and rich text editor. Follow these steps to create experiment components:

1. Navigate to the specific component you want to edit, such as Aim, Theory, etc.
2. Choose the Markdown editor or the rich text editor to write and structure the content.
3. Save your changes to update the experiment component.

### Uploading Simulation Files

To incorporate interactive simulations into your experiments, you can upload simulation files. Please note that only single file uploads are supported. Follow these steps to upload a simulation file:

1. Click on corresponding tab (i.e css, js, images) to upload simulation. Then click on "View/Upload Simulation `CSS/JS/Images`" card
2. Click on the upload button and select the file to be uploaded.
3. Repeat the process for additional simulation files.

## Known Limitations

- It is not possible to select and upload multiple simulation files simultaneously. Each file must be added individually.

## Future Updates and Features

- Integration of an IDE for managing and coding simulations in web interface without dependence on local system.
