# Uploading Simulations

In Virtual Labs, each experiment contains simulations, which are computer-based tools that allow students and researchers to simulate real-world laboratory experiments in a virtual environment. Simulations consist of various files, including HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript code, and images.

The simulations are organized in a directory structure as follows:

- `simulations/`: This is the root directory for all simulations.
  - `css/`: This folder contains CSS stylesheets specific to the simulations.
  - `js/`: This folder contains JavaScript code specific to the simulations.
  - `images/`: This folder stores the images used in the simulations.
  - `index.html`: This HTML file serves as the main page for the simulation.

To upload simulation files, follow these steps:

1. Collection Pane: After logging in, you will see a **Collection** Pane on the left side of the page. This pane contains tabs representing different folders related to simulations, such as **Simulation**, **Simulation CSS**, **Simulation JS**, and **Simulation Images**. These tabs are connected to the corresponding folders in the simulations directory structure.

2. Select Tab: Click on the tab that corresponds to the type of file you want to upload. For example, if you want to upload a CSS file for the simulation, click on the **Simulation CSS** tab.

3. Upload Card: In the center of the page, you will find a card labeled "**View/Upload Simulation CSS**" (replace "Simulation CSS" with the appropriate tab name). Click on this card to open the upload screen.

4. Media Asset Pane: This will open the **Media Asset** pane, which is linked to the respective folder (simulation, simulation/css, simulation/js, or simulation/images). The **Media Asset** pane provides options for managing your files.

7. Upload File: In the **Media Asset** pane, click on the **Upload** button to select a file from your local system and upload it to the corresponding folder.

8. Additional Options: The **Media Asset** pane also offers additional options such as downloading a selected file, copying the file path, or deleting the selected file if needed. These options allow you to manage your simulation files effectively.

9. Publishing Changes: After you have uploaded the simulation files, make sure to click on the **Publish** button to save your changes and make them available for users to access.

Repeat these steps for each file you want to upload, ensuring that you select the appropriate tab and follow the same process for each file type (HTML, CSS, JS, or images).

Remember to save your changes and ensure that all the simulation files are successfully uploaded to the appropriate folders.

By following these steps, you can easily upload simulation files to the Virtual Labs platform and enhance the virtual laboratory experience for users.
