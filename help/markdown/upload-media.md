Within Virtual Labs Builder, you can upload media files, such as images, which can be used in different components of your experiment, like the Aim or Theory. Uploading media files enhances your experiment and allows you to create an immersive learning experience. To upload media files, follow these steps:

1. Navigation Bar: At the top of the page, you will find a navigation bar. Click on the **Media** button in the navigation bar. This will open a pane titled **Media assets** where you can manage your uploaded media files.

3. **Uploading Media Files**: To upload a new media file, click the **Upload** button in the top right section of the pane. This will open a file explorer window, allowing you to select the image file or media file you wish to upload. Once you've chosen the file, click "Open" or a similar button to start the upload process. The uploaded media file will now be available in your media assets.

4. **Downloading Media Files**: If you want to download a selected media file, click the **Download** button in the top right section of the pane. This will initiate the download of the selected media file to your device, enabling you to save it locally.

5. **Copying Media File Path**: The **Copy** button in the top right section of the pane allows you to copy the path of the selected media file to your clipboard. You can then paste the file path in other components or sections of your experiment where you want to reference or use the media file.

6. **Deleting Media Files**: To remove a selected media file, click the **Delete selected** button in the top right section of the pane. This will permanently delete the selected media file from your media assets. Exercise caution while deleting, as this action cannot be undone.

By following these steps, you can easily upload media files, manage them, and leverage them in different components of your remote experiment. Enjoy creating an engaging and interactive learning experience!
