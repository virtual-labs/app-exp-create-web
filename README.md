# Virtual Labs Content Development Platform

## Introduction

The Virtual Labs Content Development Platform is a web-based Content Management System built over Netlify CMS designed to facilitate the creation of virtual experiments. It offers a user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for users to have prior knowledge of Git and Markdown. With this platform, experiment creators can easily build and manage virtual experiments while having the convenience of seamless deployment as it gives an online option to develop experiments which does not require any downloads or local setup.

## Target Audience

The Virtual Labs Content Development Platform primarily targets Virtual Labs content creators with less software development knowledge. These creators can be Virtual Labs Consortium members or even independent experiment creators. The platform gives them an online platform for experiment development and frees them from the compulsion of setting up a local development environment before they can start building their content.
