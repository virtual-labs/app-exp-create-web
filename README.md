# Virtual Labs CMS

## Introduction

The Virtual Labs CMS is a web-based Content Management System (CMS) designed to facilitate the creation of virtual experiments. It offers a user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for users to have prior knowledge of Git and Markdown. With this CMS, experiment creators can easily build and manage virtual experiments while having the convenience of seamless deployment as it gives an online option to develop experiments which does not require any downloads or local setup.

## Target Audience

The Virtual Labs CMS primarily targets Virtual Labs content creators with less software development knowledge. These creators can be Virtual Labs Consortium members or even independent experiment creators. The CMS gives them an online platform for experiment development and frees them from the compulsion of setting up a local development environment before they can start building their content.

## Feature List

The key features of Virtual Labs CMS include:

- Documentation and help resources: Provide user documentation and help files to guide users through the experiments.
- User-Friendly Interface: The CMS offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the experiment creation and management process. Users can navigate through the CMS effortlessly and access all the necessary tools and features.
- Experiment Component Creation: Experiment creators can choose between the Markdown editor and the rich text editor to create various experiment components such as Aim, Theory, and more. The editor provides a familiar and straightforward environment for writing and structuring experiment content.
- Simulation File Upload: The CMS allows users to upload simulation files from their local systems directly to the experiment's Git repository. This feature enables experiment creators to incorporate interactive simulations seamlessly into their experiments.
- Real-Time Deployment: The Virtual Labs CMS ensures that any changes made to experiments are deployed in real-time to GitHub Pages. Experiment creators can instantly see the updated version of their experiments and observe how the changes impact the overall experience.
